10,Counter-Strike,"  Update to my review with some shameless advertising 05/10/2016:   Hey readers. I am now hosting a server on CS 1.6 where you can play and enjoy the fun experiences I did back in the day.   Map rotations vary from Vehicle, Aim, Surf, Knife, Defusal, and Hostage maps! IP Address: 173.199.73.78:27025     Review 21/10/2014:   I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.  Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.   func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.  Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.  You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?  Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...  There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles.   1337/10  Leet crew 5 lyf  Kicks csgo's â™¥â™¥â™¥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.  P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!  Oh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.",1,1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing. I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never. For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story.  SO COUNTER-STRIKE FTW â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ES!!",1,1,0
10,Counter-Strike," After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world .   While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004).  Congratulations, Valve .    Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world .",1,0,1

Come the post graduation years, and I found myself playing this again, this time.. on a competitive level and making sure I had fun, the entire time I spent, whistling away at this ..

UPDATE: Valve has replied to my message, and only said 'Never email us again or we will ban your Steam account'. Yes. So I wondered, what if I ran this through my decoder machine? So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.  What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.   UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at  xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com . Thanks.   UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all.   Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.",1,1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"You are 14 years old, first time trying to play something multiplayer and online. You see this game, since you have a potatoe PC you start to play this game. Runs smoothly on 53 FPS, woow sounds are great, look an AK-47 but name CV-47 you play it you shoot, you get killed asking yourself how you didn't kill him cause you shot 27 bullets on that guy and he still is alive. You play it over and over, finally getting your first kill. (cause the enemy was coruching and looking the other way and you instantly kill him running 17 bullets spent) you get high hopes, I can play this game it is so easy. You get more kills, you get greedy you rush alone you get killed when you even thought about rushing by an AWP on mid. Ages pass, poeple pass, kills get comon. You start to play better, after 2 years you learn the recoils you learn the hidding spots, you know what is the enemy's next move. You practise your awp then. You play DM and DM only with an awp, your kills are slick, and your flicks are quick and accurate. Admin invites you to his clan. FIrst time you play this game with somenone for serious. You can't do anything cause you are not used to an opposite player to play smartly and you get owned, you don't do kills and your teammates question your skill. Couple more months pass you learn your duties as a teammate. You give info you cover you open. Clan gets closed down, you find another clan you are one of the best players. You play more switch clans for better ones. You get to LANs you get scared of the all expecations and so many eyes on you. You tilt and miss your shots, months pass, you get better, you become a man of steel and high nervous, 2000 hours pass you are finally a great player. 10 000 hours pass, you win LANs you play against better players, you try a gainst payed players you are toe-to-toe with them but you loose cause your team isn't on that level and they get scared. 20 000 hours pass game is dying and so is your love for this game. But no one can pay thoose voice chats from 8 P.M till 6 A.M every weekend with your friends. So much hours in this game and you acomplished nothing. You play against your local teams you get banned cause they don't expect somene to play that good without cheats and you stop playing this cause cheaters take over, very 12 year old first downloads a cheat then this game. You get mentally tortured cause the kid is telling you how bad you are and that you suck, you cry inside. Thinking what happened to me, how come this kid plays better then me, then you figure out the cheats are great, but you still play it fairly. You cry cause no one cares for e-sports in your country and no one wants to pay you for playing games. Your parents tell you you don't have a life you loose some friends, you loose your girlfriend you stop being active in sports. YOu just play this game hoping to be recognised, but you don't so to help everyone in this world after 30 000 hours on this game, don't play it it is a sinking ship and it is pulling you down. Tears are in my eyes for all the time I was good but now you can't play a normal match since cheaters will destory you... run READER, move away, press back and never turn back on this game..",-1,1,1

10,Counter-Strike,"A great game of cat-and-mouse where you either play as a terrorist (plant bombs or hold hostages) or counter-terrorist (defend bombsites or rescue hostages). Either complete those objectives or kill all players of the opposing team to win the round.  Counter-Strike is a fast-paced, realistic shooter that encourages teamwork so play with a friend (it's also more fun). The graphics hasn't aged well but the guns still looks authentic. One thing I hate about Counter-Strike is when you die, you have to sit and wait until the round ends. Even if the rounds are usually short, it's frustrating and it puts a ton of anxiety to your efforts of staying alive. Fortunately, Counter-Strike has tons of mods available so you're able to play the game in many different ways. This helps the game from becoming monotonous and keep the game fresh.  There's also not a lot of detail in the sound, other than the guns, but that's a minor complaint. The mods, dedicated servers and competitive nature of the game is what holds this game together to this day and that's why millions of people still play this old-school game. Although there are many better shooters on the market now, Counter-Strike's unique gameplay is what keeps me coming back from time to time.  8/10 - GREAT GAME",1,0,0

10,Counter-Strike,"Welcome to the worldâ€™s most fun over rated pile of â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥.   Since I first got a PC nearly 3 years ago all I have ever heard is counter strike, counter strike, counter strike. And, after about 15 hours of play time I see why.   Right away I can see that when counter strike came out it was the magnum opus of the fps/multiplayer genre and I can respect that but that also explains the largest problem with counter strike, its nonexistent learning curve. For the first maybe 3 hours I played on a few different servers and never killed a single person. I figured Iâ€™m new to this and it seems as thoe these guys/girls have been playing much longer than I have been so I began to brush it off and then 2 hours and may servers later I had killed maybe 6 people, not much had changed. And then remembered that thatâ€™s stupid, I shouldnâ€™t be playing against people that have 150 hours clocked while I have 5.  Another problem is the weapons  I can understand the weird names, Valve would have been a smaller company then and saved a buck by naming them weird stuff but that doesnâ€™t mean I wonâ€™t still make fun of them. The damaged ratio is also complete â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥. The sniper rifle is a one hit kill the subs are useless and I was once hit across the map with a shot gun blast. The knife is a bit under powered but Thats better than it being a light saber. And For some reason the only guns that are ever used are the AK look alike the M16 look alike and the sniper rifle.   I should say that counter strike is not a bad a game. It's for sure a sextillion times better than any Call of Duty ever made. And I will confess that this game is more fun giving your friends ADHD kid a gram of cocaine and telling him his dad is made of candy. But itâ€™s also as frustrating as trying to put that same kid in a car seat. ",1,0,1

335120,Serpent in the Staglands,"Firstly, everything that you've read about this games opacity and difficulty is true. I never played Darklands, it's 'spiritual predecessor', but just about every other 16bit classic I have - including Ultima VII again, only recently.   I liked: The setting, character and the writing of the game. At times knowing or literate or funny, and at others merely enjoyably silly. It felt like the strongest part of the game. I like the 'feel' of the low magic (even if it's less exciting to play, and it is.) The skills system is clever and would probably reward more play than I'm prepared to put into this game.  So what did I bounce off, given that list of positives? This game still feels very much like an alpha build, rushed to publishers demands, and incomplete. The feedback in the world is at times non-existent. I spent HOURS trying to figure out where a particular well was(a quest was pointing me at it.) in the first town. No text cues at all, you're meant to see a tiny altered graphic on the screen, and it clearly isn't MEANT to be obscure. Just one example, but that felt typical of the play experience. The load times are just horrendous, and indicative of ineffecient coding and design - oh, and you'll be seeing the gratingly amateurish death and load screens a lot, almost as much as you'll be playing. This is as the combat is brutal and unforgiving, unknowingly encounter enemies for the first time and die. Again and again and again, till you start learning what the games systems. And BUGS. BUGS everywhere! sometimes game stopping. You can read about them all elsewhere.  I find that now I just don't care enough, certainly not enough to have paid Â£15 to be a beta tester on a game. I am already sick of the game's flaws.  There's much to admire about this game and its creation, but unfortunately not as much to enjoy.",-1,1,0

292420,Panzer Elite Action Fields of Glory,"This is a pack of two games (Panzer Elite Action 'Dunes of War' and 'Fields of Glory') with lots of potential but excuted poorly in several ways. First, the Tiger tanks are rendered without their turrets in both games. I can't believe that wasn't caught in their quality checks. Second, the tank physics in several missions is like more like a beach ball than a multi-ton armored vehicle. If a tank from your squad runs into you, your tank is bounced off the ground or spun around like a beach ball. In one mission I was bounced into a mine field and blew up. In the D-Day mission, the Sherman rolls over easily at the slightest slope of beach. Third, the tank treads are not animated. Let me also summarize every mission: Shoot waves of enemy tanks. Expect anti-tank guns to ambush you around every corner. Find health. Find ammo. Repeat endlessly. If you are looking for strategy or variation this is not your game. Gameplay gets really tedious, especially in Dunes of War. It becomes a question of 'Can I find health?' not 'How can I out-think my enemy?' It's a shame really because the graphics are not bad. The voice actors are pretty good. The historical vignettes with old movie footage are pretty good too. Gameplay is OK. There are no on-screen instructions in Dunes of War so play Fields of Glory first so you learn the keyboard commands. I am still looking for that magic, amazing, well-conceived tank game you can play over and over. This is not it.",-1,1,0

348710,,"Did I enjoy playing this game? YES. Can I recommend it to anyone? NOT REALLY, especially if you consider that insanely high price!  Trying to keep pros and cons simple:  + Brings back a lot of memories. I love Saint Seiya (or CDZ, how we call it in Brazil) since I was very little. That was my first anime, really, and it's basically as old as as I am.  + One of the game modes lets you run through the same fights as in the original anime and there's really a trip down the memory lane. Amazing! - But if you're unfamiliar with Saint Seiya, don't even bother. The story goes by so fast in this game you won't understand a thing.  + It's a decent fighting game... - But very, very simple. And once you learn how to   master Shun's long-ranged chains--Heavy, Heavy, Heavy Explosive, run to the enemy, charge cosmo, rinse and repeat--,   the game is yours.  + The VO in Brazilian Portuguese is AWESOME! They managed to gather the same people from when the anime was dubbed about 2 decades ago. That's really this game's   high point  . - But the written translation really sucks. The dubbers managed to fix a few of the mistakes (even though it's not their job), but I expected perfect QA from such an expensive game. Even if forgive tons of punctuation and spelling errors, the translators didn't seem to have even bothered to research how the names of characters and special moves were originally translated.  + There are lots of stuff (cloths, assist phrases, music, figurines etc) to unlock... - And, although most of them are fun to collect, a few of them are insanely grindy.  + You can also play online against other people... - At least in theory, because I could never find a match. Online seems a lot more dead than dead characters in Saint Seiya =p  + Graphics are very loyal to the series and the moves are very pretty to watch, especially Big Bang Attacks - But the polygons overlapping, series of lazy repeated animations and other issues makes this game look a lot older than it is.   Final words:  All in all, this game is decent enough to play if you're a die-hard fan of Saint Seiya and if you don't consider that crazy price tag. Would I get this again if I had the chance to rethink (I bought it when it was 66% off, btw... that should've been the full price)? Probably, but only because I'm really a huge fan.  If you're still thinking of buying it, you probably love the series as much as I do, so go ahead. But keep in mind that this is just a money grab game. Shut up and take my money--rekindling old memories feels really good sometimes ;)",-1,1,0

25910,Supreme Ruler 2020: Gold,"[Edited first two paragraphs for clarification.] I will not write a complete review, there are enough of those here. I will not rant, either. I have played the game and I like the concept; the complexity, micro-managing and pace are fine by me (except you either get declared war on by everybody immediately or nothing happens at all). When I started playing it, I had fun.  However, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game for a very simple reason: It's incomplete and has several hefty issues with elements that are vital to the gameplay (AI and performance), and thus borders on a scam; at the very least, it reflects poorly on BattleGoat's business ethics.  This game (main game and addon) was supposed to receive additional attention after release, adding several more features (including a fallout/radioactivity and an environmental impact system). The game did indeed receive several content updates and additional features but, sadly, BattleGoat abandoned the game before the addition and/or revision of several critical features, leaving the game with a stupid AI, pretty damn buggy and, worst of all, content incomplete (which shows - there are buildings, designs, research that are completely pointless because the corresponding parts of the game were never implemented).  I therefore recommend that you avoid this game (and other games from BattleGoat) at all cost. This game is basically a polished Alpha and if the devs couldn't be bothered to finish this game, even after people already bought it, they are not worth your attention. Business practices like that should not be condoned or supported, so think twice before you buy from them - There may very well be a better, finished game out there.     EDIT: Since one of the devs commented on this 'review' (and my full response doesn't fit in a single comment), I will add his statement and my response to it to the 'review' itself.   chrisahl [developer] wrote:  'Many statements in this review are completely false. The game received multiple updates for approximately 18 months after release of the core game including the life cycle of the expansion pack. The game is no buggy, it is one of the most stable titles on the market. I'll hold it up to anything else out there. Features such as radioactive fallout where never promised and many never promised features were added. The content was also completed with multiple campaigns and scenarios. The tech tree is complete containing hundreds of technologies to research. Unit designs are all buildable and as usable as their specs warrant.'     I don't know what game you're talking about, Chris, but it's not this game.   I played it a lot more than my record says, and there are few games that have crashed so often on me as this one (which is why I eventually stopped playing when you guys announced that you were moving on - it got to the point where it was simply not enjoyable because the game became more unstable [and lost a lot of performance] as the world progressed and units were built). And that happened pretty much in every session because, of course, you need an army to get stuff done. For what it sets out to do, the game is not nearly optimized enough - and that's not great but we can chalk that up to a lack of experience if we want to be nice about it. That, however, does not apply to the crashes. Those are bugs (unless you want to call it a feature?) and gamebreaking bugs that are left in the game at the end of its lifecycle (which is technically not over since Steam allows you to still make some sales) are not exactly a sign of good business ethics.  As for fallout and environment: You can say they weren't 'promised', great. And I realize that I implied that you didn't add anything to the game (which I have rectified), which is unfair. But it still doesn't reflect positively on the development team when they obviously intended to implement it, put in some elements (and adjusted tooltips to hint at this feature and tell the player what he'd need this building or that research for), then decided 'Oooh, lets do this, this and this first' instead of delivering on what was already halfway done and, finally, announced that they were done with the game when there were still a lot of loose ends. The least you can do is go through it and remove the redundant content.  Yes, that would have been extra work for you guys when you were eager to create your Cold War version of this, but it would have been at least an attempt at making it look like you were sorry about it.  (As for the other things you mentioned [campaigns, tech tree, units]... Well, I don't really know why you did. I didn't put their existence into doubt and their being there doesn't change that some other features simply did not receive enough attention.)",-1,1,0
431330,Dungeons Are Random,"Just submitted a refund request. Would have stuck with this if it was in Early Access. I love the genre of RPG Roguelikes, as this type of game happens to be my favorite.

I understand one hit kills and everything after having played games like Spelunky and Nuclear Throne and games of the like, but this is absurdly unplayable. I'll keep checking back in on it to see how it does because I really wanted to have another game to constantly do runs and level characters in. It's not the time waster that I was hoping for.

Issues: The game does a spinny-camera intro to EVERY level - it can be sped-up a bit but not skipped - why!? There's no Undo - in a game which focusses on finding the best/shortest route to the end - I gave up getting 100%'s almost as soon as I realised that.  Otherwise it's fine but there's too much 'spinny/twinkly' stuff and not enough time spent making it playable IMO - ditch the spinny thing, add an Undo and we can talk again...  p.s. if UNDO is too much work, just reducing the 'move count' if you move a piece immediate back the way it came would be better than what's happening now. It's a puzzle, not a twitch movement game?",-1,0,0

You go to turn, he turns sideways, but continues to move in the direcdtion he was running... now running sideways. You let go the W key to stop... he keeps running... takes about 50 feet to stop. This alone ruined this game for me. Already uninstalled it,... Moving on the ES 2. (bought the trilogy for 16 bux...) so I don't feel I wasted too much money on the first one, just wasted 2 hours is all. Oh, and you don't do a lot of sniping in this game.

Also there are only two enemies (three if you count a stag you see), which makes the one minor enemy that much more annoying.  The game suffers from some minor glitches. Nothing game breaking.  The best part of the game is the music. If you're at all interested in the game get it on a sale.",-1,0,0

502910,The Return Home Remastered,"I bought the game last week, game wasn't properly published (thus unplayable) until I had a chat with Steam Support. That said, here's the review after the game became playable.  The Return Home is a game about a rabbit thrown out of its home by lizards for an inexplicable reason and now the rabbit's after revenge.  From the time I've spent playing the game, I'd say you can beat this game in about 20 minutes or less. The first half of the game is you just running around on a fetch quest, the second half is a sketchy FPS against the shoddy AI lizards you spent the first half running away from, after which the game just ends out of the blue.  The graphics are okay and it's always neat to see some cel-shading. However, several problems arise with broken lighting and other visual effects, causing significant performance lag, especially on the second half of the game.  The in-game music is mostly just a semi-repetitive beat akin to certain tracks from the Serious Sam games. The cutscene music is excessively loud in comparison. You can't skip the cutscenes and the options only become available after entering the game itself.  In short, despite its low price tag, the game is not currently in a state you'd get much bang for your buck. It'd probably last you longer than a candy bar, but the aftertaste isn't as pleasant. Don't get it.  Also, what's up with that completely empty 'About' button in the main menu?",-1,1,1
33760,Amelia Earhart,"I bought this game mainly due to the subject matter. Although, they may have took some liberties with the story, it really does follow along quite well with history, for beginners. The game is very short though and I was hoping for more history to be involved with the game. The graphics are pretty standerd of most HOG. The puzzle were excessively easy though, but I actually did enjoy the hidden object scenes as they were a bit more challenging then most HOG's I have played.   I can't give this a thumbs up however as it just needed some more story as well as the puzzles were way too easy. As far as the subject matter there is a bit to learn if you haven't read or seen much about Earhart. Otherwise nothing is new news to be sure as I have watched documentaries about the findings on the island in question many years ago but we still haven't had definitive answers yet. I give the game a 5/10 moslty because I'm glad someone did a HOG on an interesting historical person and mystery and also the HOG part of the game was a nice challenge.",-1,0,0

One can clearly see that the game graphics move different than Chaperone. Same can be tested with Steam menu overlay. This is the first VR experience where I feel dizziness by looking around.   Frame rate is fine (Core I7 3770K, GTX980). Also it looks that the translation/scaling of movement is not ok, means the movement distance in reality is differnt from what is shown in VR.

270170,Depression Quest,"This game's purpose was to raise awareness on what depression felt like to those who didn't suffer from it; which it did, but all too well. I personally did not think I was depressed, but after playing this game I had slight hesitations in my head: 'Am I actually depressed?'  It delivered it's purpose all too much, with the very detailed information and sound. It felt too real, and really made me think in the character's perspective. At the same time, I was disappointed every time when I couldn't click on the crossed out option, which is obviously the option for those who aren't depressed. It seemed as though although I wanted to take the more cheery option, it was out of my reach and ended up having to take another option which I felt wasn't my first option.   While this game is completely successful in it's purpose, I will not recommend this game even to those who are not depressed just for the fact that it could affect your life negatively, and is not worth any positive points that could be taken from this game.",-1,0,0

Although there are some cheaters who take advantage of the game from time to time, I manage to find a good, clean lobby very often.

102700,A.V.A. Alliance of Valiant Armsâ„¢,"i didnt play this game but im allowed to write a review boobies 10/10 also a recipe for banana bread   No need for a mixer for this recipe! Clean-up is easy too, if you want, you can mix everything in one bowl. The best bananas to use for banana bread are those that are over-ripe. The yellow peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.  Ingredients 2-3 very ripe bananas, peeled 1/3 cup melted butter 1 cup of sugar (can easily use 3/4 cup, or drop it down to 1/2 cup if you want it less sweet) 1 egg, beaten 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon baking soda Pinch of salt 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour Method Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (175Â°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan. In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas. Mix in the baking soda and salt. Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour. Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan. Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes (check at 50 minutes) at 350Â°F (175Â°C), or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool completely on a rack. Remove the banana bread from the pan. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)   ",1,1,1
